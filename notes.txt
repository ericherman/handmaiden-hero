commit a7ad7190e2 similar to
Handmade Hero Day 013 - Platform-independent User Input

however, I focused on keyboard rather than joystick because I do not
have a gampad.

commit 59617f6acf approx linux+SDL parity with
Handmade Hero Day 012 - Platform-independent Sound Output

There are two issues with the SDL sound code. First, volume does not
seem to be hooked up to anything other than 0 or TOO-LOUD. Second,
and more interestingly, there seems to be a glitch when changing pitch,
so more debugging is required.

commit 892ff92 is approximate linux+SDL parity with
Handmade Hero Day 011 - The Basics of Platform API Design
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4vnV2Eng7M

It should be noted that the platform independent code is not enforced
to be platform independent as it could be because the #defines for
_GNU and _POSIX currently happen before the inclusion of the independent
due to conflicting imports. This can be addressed in a couple of ways.
Having the platform independent code call ABSOLUTELY no standard C library
includes would work. Also it is possible that very careful inclusion order
might work. Wrapping libc code (printf and friends) as platform code would
work. Or, retreating from a single the monolithic build to platform and
non-platform build steps, plus a linking step would work.

commit ca5bb023 does the keyboard input portion of
"Handmade Hero Day 006 - Gamepad and Keyboard Input"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3y1x54vyIQ

I do not have a game controller, so I will skip that part for now.
Perhaps, I will return to that at some point in the future.

commit dfe59017 is approximate linux+SDL parity with
"Handmade Hero Day 005 - Windows Graphics Review"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ay7QXmo_o

I spent some time trying to figure out how to use Xlib in a non-stupid
way, but as that has not yet panned out, I have elected to go with SDL
for the time being.

commit bfbb786d is approximate linux parity with
"Handmade Hero Day 005 - Windows Graphics Review"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ay7QXmo_o

However, the way I am drawing on the screen is very, very slow.
Also the way I am using the XEvent loop might be totally wrong.

commit f8447e9f is approximate parity with end of
"Handmade Hero Day 001 - Setting Up the Windows Build"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee3EtYb8d1o

I am not going to bother with windows, rather I will stay in linux land.

However, the video included creating a "hello, world" style window program,
so to mimic this, I modified an exmaple from geeks3d.com:
